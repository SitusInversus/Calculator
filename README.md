Project Calculator

Following instrunctions from "The Odin Project" to build a Calculator using HTML, CSS and JS

Steps:

1. Setup html, css and js files and link them

2. General Layout of a Calculator:
    a. Form: rectangle, top quarter of rectangle: display, rest: 3/4 input
    b. Display: 
        top half: Result of previous mathematical operation
        bottom half: Current operation, not executed
    c. Input: 10 number buttons, 4 operand buttons, "All Clear" Button, "Delete" Button, "Equal" Button, "." Button
        => 18 Buttons

3. Using Grid to implement the surface of the Calculator would be a good solution but since at this point I havent learned it yet.
    Use CSS+Flexbox

4. to create the necessary JS code I will follow the given steps by "The Odin Project"

    a. Create 4 functions which -add -subtract -multiply    -divide

    b. Create a function which takes 2 numbers and 1 operator to calculate the result
